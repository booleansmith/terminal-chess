# terminal-chess
A terminal implementation of chess in c++!

 My intentions for this project are as follows:

- Encourage the practice of healthy code maintenance
  - Healthy git practices
  - Meaningful and helpful documentation
  - Make and CMAKE
- Enjoy solving moderately difficult (to me) c++ algorithm problems
- Maintain existing c++ skills and explore new ones

This application will never be as cool as [lichess](https://github.com/lichess-org), if I wanted it to be, I wouldn't be starting in C++. The goals for this project, in combination with my acceptance that this project will never evolve into my preffered application for playing chess, provide a stress free enjoyable space to write code and explore best practices for c++ code.
